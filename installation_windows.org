#+TITLE: Installation of MathComp and monae on Windows 10

On a Linux-based system, one can use opam to install MathComp and
monae as explained in the [[file:README.org][README]].

On Windows 10, the installation process is not that easy mostly
because opam is not robust enough yet (but this is improving!).  The
process relies on [[https://www.cygwin.com][cygwin]] to recreate a Linux-like environment. Two
caveats: (1) file access with cygwin is slow compared to a native
Linux installation (this is bearable when using MathComp but this
makes the installation very slow), (2) cygwin's opam does not seem to
be usable (we have to perform a non-cygwin installation of opam). See
(alternative 2) below for installation with "opam for Windows".  In
case (alternative 2) does not work, try (alternative 1): it avoids
opam completely and use the binary distribution of Coq for Windows 10
to compile the desired libraries one after the other using ~make~.

* Step 1: Install cygwin
- Download and execute ~setup-x86_64.exe~ from [[https://www.cygwin.com/][https://www.cygwin.com/]]
  + Choose ~xinit~, ~make~, ~diffutils~, ~patch~, ~unzip~, ~git~,
    ~emacs~, ~emacs-X11~, ~vim~, ~texlive~ to have a minimal working
    environment
- Double-click the "Cygwin64 Terminal" on the Desktop
- In the terminal, execute ~startxwin~ to start X11
  + An Cygwin-X11 icon (a black "C" with a green "X" inside) appears
    among the System Tray icons
  + Right-clicking the Cygwin-X11 icon gives access to ~xterm~
    * You can launch ~emacs~ from the command line
* Step 2 (alternative 1): Install MathComp using Coq Binaries
** Step 2a: Install Coq
- Download and execute ~coq-8.9.1-installer-windows-x86_64.exe~ from
  the [[https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/latest][release page]]
  + This will add the Coq distribution as the ~C:\Coq~ directory
- Add ~/cygdrive/c/coq/bin~ to ~PATH~
  + By appending ~export PATH=${PATH}:/cygdrive/c/coq/bin/~ to
    ~.bashrc~ for example
** Step 2b: Install MathComp
- The MathComp library that comes with the Coq binaries is maybe not
  up-to-date
  + ~rm /cygdrive/c/coq/lib/user_contrib/mathcomp~
- Install MathComp 1.9.0
  + Download the [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/releases][source files]]
  + Installation amounts to: unzip, untar, cd, make, make install
  + As a result the MathComp libraries populate the ~user-contrib~
    directory of the Coq installation
* Step 2 (alternative 2): Install MathComp using opam
The following results in a more comfortable working environment but
the process is slow and may fail. Still, at least, it should leave you
with a working OCaml compiler to compile Coq from the source and go on
installing MathComp as in *Step 2b*.
** Step 2(bis)a: Install opam
- For opam to work, add a few more useful programs by re-running the
  cygwin installer
  + ~rsync~, ~curl~, ~m4~, ~perl~, ~mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core~
- [[https://github.com/fdopen/opam-repository-mingw/releases/download/0.0.0.2/opam64.tar.xz][Download]] opam
- ~tar -xf opam64.tar.xz~
- ~bash opam64/install.sh~
- ~opam init default "https://github.com/fdopen/opam-repository-mingw.git#opam2" -c "ocaml-variants.4.07.1+mingw64c" --disable-sandboxing~
  + this modifies ~.bash_profile~
- ~eval $(opam config env)~
- ~opam switch create 4.07.1+mingw64c~
  + if for some reason the right OCaml compiler is still not here
** Step 2(bis)b: Install Coq
- ~opam install camlp5~ ([2019-07-12 Fri]'s version: 7.06)
- ~opam install ocamlfind~ ([2019-07-12 Fri]'s version: 1.8.0)
- ~opam install depext~ ([2019-07-12 Fri]'s version: transition)
- ~opam install depext-cygwinports~ ([2019-07-12 Fri]'s version: 0.0.7)
  + Add ~/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin~ to ~PATH~ as indicated
- ~opam install pcre~
  + mail fail partially, but this is no worry because it should not
    prevent you from installing Coq, MathComp, etc.
- try ~opam install lablgtk~
  + the complete installation is likely to fail, this means no
    ~coqIDE~, but this is no problem because there is Proof General
- ~opam install num~ ([2019-07-12 Fri]'s version: 1.2)
- ~opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released~
- ~opam install coq.8.9.1~
** Step 2(bis)c: Install MathComp
- ~export CAML=/home/username/.opam/4.07.1+mingw64c/bin/~
- ~export COQBIN=/home/username/.opam/4.07.1+mingw64c/bin/~
- ~opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect~ ([2019-07-12 Fri]'s version: 1.9.0)
- ~opam install coq-mathcomp-fingroup~
- ~opam install coq-mathcomp-algebra~
- ~opam install coq-mathcomp-field~
* Step 3: Install Proof General
- Install proof general following the instructions [[https://proofgeneral.github.io/][online]]
- Add this point, you can already use Coq and /some version/ of
  MathComp almost as if you were on a Linux-based system
* Step 4: Install the Required Libraries on Top of MathComp and Then monae
** In case you chose Step 2:
- Install MathComp-Analysis using unzip, untar, cd, make, make install
  1. Install bigenough 1.0.0 ([[https://github.com/math-comp/bigenough][download]]) 
  2. Install finmap 1.2.1 ([[https://github.com/math-comp/finmap][download]])
  3. Install analysis 0.2.2 ([[https://github.com/math-comp/analysis][download]])
- Install Infotheo using ~coq_makefile~, ~make~, ~make install~
  + [[https://github.com/affeldt-aist/infotheo][download]]
- Install monae
  + ~git clone git@github.com:affeldt-aist/monae.git~
  + ~coq_makefile -o Makefile -f _CoqProject~
  + ~make~
  + optionally, ~make install~
** In case you chose Step 2(bis) (and succeeded):
- ~opam install coq-mathcomp-bigenough~ (1.0.0)
- ~opam install coq-mathcomp-finmap.1.2.1~
- ~opam install coq-mathcomp-analysis.0.2.2~
- ~opam install coq-mathcomp-infotheo~ (0.0.1)
+ ~git clone git@github.com:affeldt-aist/monae.git~
+ ~opam install .~
* Troubleshooting and Failures
** Cygwin Troubleshooting
- Cygwin may be confused by a non-American keyboard; you can change
  the keyboard layout with ~setxkbmap~, e.g., for a Japanese keyboard,
  ~setxkbmap -model jp106 -layout jp~
- You may want to get rid of the CAPS LOCK key by creating a file,
  say, ~Xmodmap~ with the following contents:
#+BEGIN_SRC
keycode 66 = Control_L
clear Lock
add Control = Control_L
#+END_SRC
  Then append the following to ~.bashrc~:
#+BEGIN_SRC
xmodmap /home/username/Xmodmap
#+END_SRC
** Opam Troubleshooting
- You may witness ~Device or resource busy~ when installing with opam,
  they seem to be harmless
- ~opam install lablgtk~ fails with the following error despite having
  ~libgtk2.0-devel~ and ~mingw64-x86_64-gtk2.0~ installed with cygwin:
#+BEGIN_SRC
This package requires gtk+ 2.0 development packages installed on your system
#+END_SRC
** Cygwin's opam troubleshooting
*** Install OCaml with cygwin's opam on Windows 10
It is possible to install the OCaml compiler using cygwin's opam
(using the procedure below) but the compiler obtained this way cannot
be used to compile Coq.
- Re-run the cygwin installer to install ~opam~ (version 2 or higher)
- ~opam init~ (Answer "y" to questions)
- ~eval $(opam env)~
- Check that OCaml has been properly installed
  + ~ocaml --version~ (version at the time of this writing [2019-07-08 Mon]: 4.04.2)
- ~opam switch create 4.07.1~
- ~eval $(opam env)~
- ~opam install camlp5~ (version 7.06.10 [2019-07-08 Mon])
- ~opam install ocamlfind~ (version 1.8.0 [2019-07-08 Mon])
- ~opam install num.1.2~
** Failure Installing Coq from the source code using cygwin's opam's OCaml
*** Using cygwin's opam
Installation fails because Coq's ~configure~ is confused by cygwin:
- ~opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released~
- ~opam install coq.8.0.1~
*** From the source, using cygwin's opam's Ocaml
Installation fails with an "address space is already occupied error" for ~dllunix.so~:
- Download ~coq.8.9.1.tar.gz~
- unzip, untar, cd, make
