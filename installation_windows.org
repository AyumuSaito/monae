#+TITLE: Installation of MathComp and monae on Windows 10

On a Linux-based system, one can use ~opam~ to install MathComp and
monae as explained in the [[file:README.org][README]].

On Windows 10, ~opam~ does not work correctly and one needs to install
the required libraries one-by-one with ~make~, using cygwin to
recreate a Unix-like environment together with the binary
distribution of Coq for Windows 10.

* Step 1: Install MathComp on Windows 10
** Step 1a: Install cygwin

 - Download and execute ~setup-x86_64.exe~ from [[https://www.cygwin.com/][https://www.cygwin.com/]]
   + Choose ~emacs~, ~emacs-X11~, ~xinit~, ~make~, ~texlive~ to have a
     minimal working environment
 - Double-click the "Cygwin64 Terminal" on the Desktop
 - In the terminal, execute ~startxwin~ to start X11
   + An Cygwin-X11 icon (a black "C" with a green "X" inside) appears
     among the System Tray icons
   + Right-clicking the Cygwin-X11 icon icon gives access to XTerm
     * You can launch emacs from the command line
 - Add a few more useful programs by re-running the cygwin installer
   + for example, the following programs would be useful in particular
     for ~opam~ that unfortunately does not work correctly on Windows 10
     + ~rsync~, ~patch~, ~make~, ~diffutils~, ~curl~, ~unzip~, ~git~,
       ~m4~, ~perl~, ~mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core~
** Step 1b: Install Coq

 - Download and execute ~coq-8.9.1-installer-windows-x86_64.exe~ from
   the [[https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/latest][release page]]
   + This will add the Coq distribution as the ~C:\Coq~ directory
 - Add ~/cygdrive/c/coq/bin~ to ~PATH~
   + By appending ~export PATH=${PATH}:/cygdrive/c/coq/bin/~ to
     ~.bashrc~ for example

** Step 1c: Install Proof General

 - Install proof general following the instructions [[https://proofgeneral.github.io/][online]]
 - Add this point, you can already use Coq and /some version/ of
   MathComp almost as if we were on a Linux-based system

** Step 1d: Install MathComp

 - The MathComp library that comes with the Coq binaries is maybe not
   up-to-date
   + ~rm /cygdrive/c/coq/lib/user_contrib/mathcomp~
 - install MathComp 1.9.0
   + download the [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/releases][source files]]
   + installation amounts to: unzip, untar, cd, make, make install
   + as result the MathComp libraries populates the ~user-contrib~
     directory of the Coq installation

* Step 2: Installed the Required Libraries on Top of MathComp and Then monae

 - Install MathComp-Analysis using unzip, untar, cd, make, make install
   1. Install bigenough 1.0.0 ([[https://github.com/math-comp/bigenough][download]]) 
   2. Install finmap 1.2.1 ([[https://github.com/math-comp/finmap][download]])
   3. Install analysis 0.2.2 ([[https://github.com/math-comp/analysis][download]])
 - Install Infotheo using ~coq_makefile~, ~make~, ~make install~
   + [[https://github.com/affeldt-aist/infotheo][download]]
 - Install monae
   + ~git clone git@github.com:affeldt-aist/monae.git~
   + ~coq_makefile -o Makefile -f _CoqProject~
   + ~make~
   + optionally, ~make install~

* Addendum
** Cygwin Troubleshooting

 - Cygwin may be confused by a non-American keyboard; you can change
   the keyboard layout with ~setxkbmap~, e.g., for a Japanese keyboard,
   ~setxkbmap -model jp106 -layout jp~
 - You may want to get rid of the CAPS LOCK key by creating a file,
   say, ~Xmodmap~ with the following contents:
 #+BEGIN_SRC
 keycode 66 = Control_L
 clear Lock
 add Control = Control_L
 #+END_SRC
   Then append the following to ~.bashrc~:
 #+BEGIN_SRC
 xmodmap /home/username/Xmodmap
 #+END_SRC

** Install OCaml with opam on Windows 10

- Re-run the cygwin installer to install ~opam~ (version 2 or higher)
- ~opam init~ (Answer "y" to questions)
- ~eval $(opam env)~
- Check that OCaml has been properly installed
  + ~ocaml --version~ (version at the time of this writing [2019-07-08 Mon]: 4.04.2)
- ~opam switch create 4.07.1~
- ~eval $(opam env)~
- ~opam install camlp5~ (version 7.06.10 [2019-07-08 Mon])
- ~opam install ocamlfind~ (version 1.8.0 [2019-07-08 Mon])
- ~opam install num.1.2~

** Failure Installing lablgtk with opam

- ~opam install lablgtk~ fails with the following error despite having
  ~libgtk2.0-devel~ and ~mingw64-x86_64-gtk2.0~ installed with cygwin:
#+BEGIN_SRC
This package requires gtk+ 2.0 development packages installed on your system
#+END_SRC

- still, ~coqIDE~ has been installed along Coq with the binary distribution for Windows 10

** Failure Installing Coq from the source code
**** Using Opam

Installation fails because of Coq's ~configure~ is confused by cygwin:
- ~opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released~
- ~opam install coq.8.0.1~

**** From the source

Installation fails with an "address space is already occupied error" for ~dllunix.so~:
- Download ~coq.8.9.1.tar.gz~
- unzip, untar, cd, make
