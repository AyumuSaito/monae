* Monadic equational reasoning in Coq

This repository contains a formalization of monads including several
models, examples of monadic equational reasoning, and an application
to program semantics.

Formalized papers:
- [Gibbons and Hinze, Just do It: Simple Monadic Equational Reasoning, ICFP 2011] (except Sect. 10.2)
- [Gibbons, Unifying Theories of Programming with Monads, UTP 2012] (up to Sect. 7.2)
- [Mu, Equational Reasoning for Non-deterministic Monad: A Case study of Spark Aggregation, TR-IIS-19-002, Academia Sinica]
- [Mu, Calculating a Backtracking Algorithm: An exercise in Monadic Program Derivation, TR-IIS-29-003, Academia Sinica]
- [Jones and Duponcheel, Composing Monads, Yale RR 1993] (Sections 2 and 3)

- [Cheung, Distributive Interaction of Algebraic Effects, PhD Thesis, U. Oxford, 2017]
- [Mu, Functional Pearls: Reasoning and Derivation of Monadic Programs, A case study of non-determinism and state, 2017]
  + This is a draft paper. In the first release, we formalized this draft up to Sect. 5.
    The contents has been since superseded by [mu2019tr2] and [mu2019tr3].
