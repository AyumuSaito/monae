* Monadic equational reasoning in Coq

This repository contains a formalization of monads
with several examples of monadic equational reasoning:
- formalization of [Gibbons and Hinze, Just do It: Simple Monadic Equational Reasoning, ICFP 2011]
  + except Sect. 10.2
- formalization of [Gibbons, Unifying Theories of Programming with Monads, UTP 2012]
  + up to Sect. 7.2
- formalization of [Mu, Functional Pearls: Reasoning and Derivation of Monadic Programs, A case study of non-determinism and state, 2017]
  + up to Sect. 5
- an application to program semantics

** Requirements

- [[https://coq.inria.fr][Coq 8.8.2]] (should be fine with slightly older versions), [[https://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/][MathComp 1.7]]
- [[https://github.com/affeldt-aist/infotheo][infotheo]] (used for probabilities)

** Installation

1. ~coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile~
2. ~make~
