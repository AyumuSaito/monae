* Monadic equational reasoning in Coq

This repository contains a formalization of monads including several
models, examples of monadic equational reasoning, and an application
to program semantics.

- [Gibbons, Unifying Theories of Programming with Monads, UTP 2012] (up to Sect. 7.2)
- [Mu, Functional Pearls: Reasoning and Derivation of Monadic Programs, A case study of non-determinism and state, 2017] (up to Sect. 5)
- [Jones and Duponcheel, Composing Monads, Yale RR 1993] (Sections 2 and 3)

** Requirements

- [[https://coq.inria.fr][Coq 8.8.2]] (should be fine with slightly older versions), [[https://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/][MathComp 1.7]]
- the compilation of [[finmonad_model.v][finmonad_model.v]] requires the installation of
  another library called [[https://github.com/affeldt-aist/infotheo][infotheo]]
  + if infotheo is not installed, just remove ~finmonad_model.v~ from ~_CoqProject~
=======

** Requirements

- [[https://coq.inria.fr][Coq]] 8.9.0
- [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp][Mathematical Components library]] 1.8.0
- [[https://github.com/math-comp/analysis][MathComp-Analysis]] github master version
  which requires
  + [[https://github.com/math-comp/bigenough/][bigenough]] first release
  + [[https://github.com/math-comp/finmap][finmap]] 1.2.0
- [[https://github.com/affeldt-aist/infotheo][infotheo]] github master version
>>>>>>> master

** Installation

1. ~make~
